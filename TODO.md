# To consider

* Optimize implementation of `sum` for size (e.g. when all of the variants are
  empty).

* Generalize `tycon`

* Implement basic recursion schemes

* Optimize representation of

    ```cpp
    shared<sum<...>>
    ```

* Do not enable conversions of sums and products in case conversions of elements
  do not exist.
